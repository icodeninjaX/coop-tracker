# Period Ledger Improvements

## Overview
Enhanced the period ledger to provide comprehensive financial tracking including loan disbursements, interest collection, and accurate balance calculations.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Ledger Calculation
- **Beginning Balance**: Now properly calculated from previous periods including:
  - Previous collections
  - Previous loan disbursements (subtracted)
  - Previous repayments (added)
- **Interest Tracking**: Added calculation of interest collected per period from loan repayments
- **Accurate Flow**: Proper cash flow calculation that reflects all financial activities

### 2. Interest Collection Tracking
- **Proportional Interest Calculation**: When loan repayments are made, the system calculates how much of each payment represents interest vs. principal
- **Period-Based Interest**: Interest is now tracked and displayed for the specific period when it was collected
- **Formula Used**: `Interest in Payment = Payment Amount × (Total Interest / Total Amount Due)`

### 3. Enhanced UI Display
- **6-Column Layout**: Expanded from 5 to 6 columns to include interest
- **Clear Categorization**: 
  - Beginning Balance (gray)
  - Collections (gray)
  - Repayments (gray)
  - **Interest (green)** - NEW: Highlights interest income
  - **Disbursements (red)** - Highlights loan disbursements as cash outflow
  - Ending Balance (gray, emphasized)

### 4. Loan Disbursement Integration
- **Period Assignment**: Loans are properly assigned to disbursement periods when approved
- **Balance Impact**: Loan disbursements correctly reduce the cooperative's cash balance
- **Disbursement Tracking**: Clear visibility of how much was disbursed in each period

## Technical Implementation

### `computeLedgerForSelected` Function Enhancement
```typescript
// Added interest calculation function
const calculateInterestFromRepayments = (periodId: string) => {
  // Calculates interest portion of each repayment in the period
  // Uses loan's interest rate and term to determine proportion
};

// Enhanced beginning balance calculation
const beginningBalance = 
  sumCollections(prevPeriods) -
  sumDisbursedInPeriods(prevPeriods.map(p => p.id)) +
  state.repayments
    .filter(r => prevPeriods.some(p => p.id === r.periodId))
    .reduce((sum, r) => sum + (r.amount || 0), 0);
```

### UI Updates
- Changed grid layout from `grid-cols-5` to `grid-cols-6`
- Added dedicated Interest column with green styling
- Applied red styling to Disbursements to highlight cash outflow
- Maintained responsive design for mobile devices

## Financial Logic

### Cash Flow Equation
```
Ending Balance = Beginning Balance + Collections + Repayments - Disbursements
```

### Interest Calculation
```
Total Interest on Loan = Principal × Interest Rate × Term
Interest Ratio = Total Interest ÷ Total Amount Due
Interest in Payment = Payment Amount × Interest Ratio
```

### Beginning Balance Calculation
```
Beginning Balance = Σ(Previous Collections) - Σ(Previous Disbursements) + Σ(Previous Repayments)
```

## Benefits

1. **Complete Financial Picture**: Shows all financial activities for each period
2. **Interest Income Tracking**: Clear visibility of interest earned per period
3. **Loan Impact Visibility**: Shows how loan disbursements affect cash flow
4. **Accurate Balance Tracking**: Proper calculation of beginning and ending balances
5. **Period-Based Analysis**: Easy comparison of financial performance across periods

## Usage

1. **Select a Period**: Choose a collection period from the dropdown
2. **View Comprehensive Ledger**: See all financial activities for that period:
   - **Beginning**: Starting cash balance
   - **Collected**: Member contributions collected
   - **Repayments**: Loan repayments received
   - **Interest**: Interest income from loan repayments (highlighted in green)
   - **Disbursed**: Loans disbursed (highlighted in red)
   - **Ending**: Final cash balance

3. **Track Interest Income**: Monitor interest earnings per period to assess loan profitability
4. **Monitor Cash Flow**: Understand how loan activities affect the cooperative's liquidity

This enhancement provides a complete and accurate picture of the cooperative's financial activities, making it easier to track performance and make informed decisions about loan approvals and cash management.
