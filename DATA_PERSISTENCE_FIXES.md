# Data Persistence Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **localStorage Key Inconsistency** ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: The `AuthContext.signOut()` function was clearing `"coopState"` but the actual keys used were `"coopState_${userId}"`.

**Solution**: Updated the signOut function to use the correct key pattern:

```typescript
// Before
localStorage.removeItem("coopState");

// After
if (user?.id) {
  localStorage.removeItem(`coopState_${user.id}`);
  localStorage.removeItem(`coopSeeded_${user.id}`);
}
```

### 2. **Race Conditions During Sign Out** ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: The sign out process was immediately clearing state and forcing a reload, potentially interrupting data saving operations.

**Solution**: Added delay to allow pending saves to complete:

```typescript
// Give components time to finish saving before clearing state
setTimeout(() => {
  // Clear state and reload
}, 500); // 500ms delay
```

### 3. **Aggressive localStorage Clearing** ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Remote state loading was immediately removing localStorage backup data.

**Solution**: Keep localStorage as backup even when remote data is available:

```typescript
// Before: Remove localStorage when remote data exists
localStorage.removeItem(`coopState_${user.id}`);

// After: Keep localStorage as backup
localStorage.setItem(`coopState_${user.id}`, JSON.stringify(remote));
```

### 4. **Unreliable Save Operation** ✅ IMPROVED

**Problem**: Save operations were attempting remote save first, which could fail and prevent localStorage saving.

**Solution**: Save to localStorage first (synchronous and reliable), then attempt remote save:

```typescript
// Always save to localStorage first
localStorage.setItem(`coopState_${user.id}`, JSON.stringify(state));

// Then attempt remote save as backup
saveRemoteState(state, user.id).catch((err) => {
  // localStorage already saved, so data is still persisted
});
```

### 5. **Remote State Upsert Optimization** ✅ IMPROVED

**Problem**: The remote save function was doing separate check/insert/update operations.

**Solution**: Use PostgreSQL upsert for atomic operation:

```typescript
// Use upsert instead of separate operations
await supabase.from(TABLE).upsert(
  {
    user_id: userId,
    data: state,
    updated_at: new Date().toISOString(),
  },
  {
    onConflict: "user_id",
    ignoreDuplicates: false,
  }
);
```

### 6. **Better Error Handling** ✅ ADDED

**Problem**: Parse errors and other failures could break the entire loading process.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive error handling:

```typescript
try {
  const parsedState = JSON.parse(savedState);
  dispatch({ type: "LOAD_STATE", payload: parsedState });
} catch (parseError) {
  console.error("Error parsing saved state:", parseError);
  // Continue with initial state instead of crashing
}
```

### 7. **Debug Tools** ✅ ADDED

**Problem**: No easy way to diagnose data persistence issues.

**Solution**: Added debugging utilities:

- `debugDataPersistence()` - Inspect localStorage contents
- `clearAllCoopData()` - Clean reset for testing
- `testDataPersistence()` - Verify localStorage functionality
- Enhanced debug page with persistence testing buttons

## Testing

1. **Run the test script**: Execute `test-persistence.js` in browser console
2. **Use debug page**: Visit `/debug` and use the persistence testing buttons
3. **Monitor console**: Check for persistence-related logs during app usage

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

- ✅ Data persists between browser sessions
- ✅ Data survives sign out/sign in cycles
- ✅ LocalStorage serves as reliable fallback
- ✅ Remote sync works when available
- ✅ No data loss during authentication changes
- ✅ Graceful handling of persistence errors
