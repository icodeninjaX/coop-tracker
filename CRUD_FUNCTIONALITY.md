## Backend Context Updates (`CoopContext.tsx`)

### New Actions Added:
```typescript
// Member CRUD
| { type: "ADD_MEMBER"; payload: { name: string } }
| { type: "UPDATE_MEMBER"; payload: { memberId: number; name: string } }
| { type: "DELETE_MEMBER"; payload: { memberId: number } }

// Loan CRUD  
| { type: "UPDATE_LOAN"; payload: { loanId: string; loan: Partial<Loan> } }
| { type: "DELETE_LOAN"; payload: { loanId: string } }
```

### Reducer Logic:
- **ADD_MEMBER**: Auto-generates next available ID

- **DELETE_MEMBER**: Cascading delete with collection total recalculation

- **DELETE_LOAN**: Cascading delete of related repayments and penalties
