# One-Time Loan Display & Rejected Loan Deletion Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ **One-Time Loan Display Issue**

**Problem**: One-time loans were still showing "Installment" information, which was confusing.

**Solution**: Updated the loan display logic to show different information based on loan type:

#### One-Time Loans (MONTHLY):

- **Before**: Showed "Full payment: ‚Ç±14,800 (due after 12 months)"
- **After**: Shows "**Payment due after 12 months:** ‚Ç±14,800 ‚Ä¢ Payment pending"

#### Per Cut-off Loans (CUT_OFF):

- **Before**: Showed "Installment: ‚Ç±983.33 / cut-off ‚Ä¢ Payments left: 12"
- **After**: Shows "Installment: ‚Ç±983.33 per cut-off ‚Ä¢ Payments left: 12"

### 2. ‚úÖ **Enhanced Delete Functionality for Rejected Loans**

**Problem**: Rejected loans needed better cleanup functionality.

**Solution**: Enhanced the delete functionality with:

#### Visual Improvements:

- **Rejected loans**: Delete button is more prominent (red background, shows "üóëÔ∏è Remove")
- **Other loans**: Standard delete button (üóëÔ∏è only)

#### Better Confirmation Messages:

- **Rejected loans**: "Remove rejected loan request of ‚Ç±10,000 for John Doe?"
- **Other loans**: "Are you sure you want to delete the loan... will remove all related data"

#### Information Banner:

- Shows count of rejected loans with cleanup reminder
- Appears only when there are rejected loans
- Guides user to use the Remove button

## Code Changes

### Display Logic Fix (`src/app/loans/page.tsx`):

```tsx
{
  loan.repaymentPlan === "MONTHLY" ? (
    /* One-time payment: Show total amount and due date */
    <p>
      <strong>Payment due after {loan.termCount} months:</strong> ‚Ç±
      {totalDue.toFixed(2)}
      {periodsLeft !== undefined
        ? ` ‚Ä¢ ${periodsLeft > 0 ? "Payment pending" : "Fully paid"}`
        : ""}
    </p>
  ) : (
    /* Per cut-off installments: Show installment details */
    installment && (
      <p>
        Installment: ‚Ç±{installment.toFixed(2)} per cut-off
        {periodsLeft !== undefined ? ` ‚Ä¢ Payments left: ${periodsLeft}` : ""}
      </p>
    )
  );
}
```

### Enhanced Delete Function:

```tsx
const deleteLoan = (
  loanId: string,
  memberName: string,
  amount: number,
  status: string
) => {
  const message =
    status === "REJECTED"
      ? `Remove rejected loan request of ‚Ç±${amount.toLocaleString()} for ${memberName}?`
      : `Are you sure you want to delete the loan of ‚Ç±${amount.toLocaleString()} for ${memberName}? This will also remove all related repayments and penalties.`;

  const confirmDelete = confirm(message);
  if (confirmDelete) {
    dispatch({
      type: "DELETE_LOAN",
      payload: { loanId },
    });
  }
};
```

### Visual Enhancement for Delete Button:

```tsx
<button
  onClick={() =>
    deleteLoan(loan.id, member?.name || "Unknown", loan.amount, loan.status)
  }
  className={clsx(
    "px-2 py-1 text-xs rounded hover:bg-red-200 focus:outline-none",
    loan.status === "REJECTED"
      ? "bg-red-200 text-red-800 font-medium" // More prominent for rejected loans
      : "bg-red-100 text-red-700"
  )}
  title={
    loan.status === "REJECTED"
      ? "Delete rejected loan request"
      : "Delete this loan and all related data"
  }
>
  üóëÔ∏è {loan.status === "REJECTED" ? "Remove" : ""}
</button>
```
